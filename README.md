## Weekly Task 02 - bank.py
This program prompts the user to enter 2 amounts in cent, adds them and prints the
answer formatted as euro and cent. It avoids the use of floating point numbers as we
are dealing wiht currency.

## Weekly Task 03 - accounts.py
This program takes in a 10 character account number and outputs the account number with 
only the last 4 digits shown (and the first 6 digits replaced by X's).
The program is extended to deal with account numbers of any length. Assumptions are
stated.

## Weekly Task 04 - collatz.py
This program demonstrates the Collatz conjecture.
It asks the user to input a positive integer and applies the Collatz conjecture to it.
The Collatz conjecture states that by applying 1 of 2 rules repeatedly, the number 
always reaches 4-2-1.
1. If the number is even, divide by 2
2. if the number is odd, multiply by 3 and add 1

## Weekly Task 05 - weekday.py
This program outputs whether or not the current day is a weekday.
If not a weekday, it also confirms that it is a weekend day.
If neither, an error message is printed.
